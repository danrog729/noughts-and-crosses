# 3D Noughts And Crosses

A WPF app made for my A-Level. Uses a custom CPU-based renderer. Enjoy.

## Installation

Download the latest release (.zip). Extract this .zip and there should be a few files in the folder. Just run nought-and-crosses.exe and start playing. If it doesn't open then please create an issue as it's probably crashed.

## Gameplay

Add players/bots using the buttons on the left. You can have up to 255. Click start game to start game. Once the game has started, click on the grid to place your move. Right-click and drag to rotate the camera. Scroll to open up the grid. The aim is to get a full line of your icon, so for a 3x3 board you need 3 in any direction, for a 5x5x5 board you need 5 in any direction.
